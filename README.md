# mirrorarch
While studying and describing the behavior of my fully Turing complete key derivation mechanismd riven by entropy, which is part of mirrormachine, I came to a realisation:

  _It is Turing complete._

It has instruction set. It is programmable. It is programmable by natural entropy.

It is essentialy programmed by entropy by design, but the program blueprint is constantly changing its
shape thanks to entropic programming being unpredictably but deterministically combined with the entropic string derived from a passphrase. The machine
itself is mutating based on the entropic sources and essentially on previous states as well (this is important, remember this for later). This is, in
the theoretical model, proposed as not being reversible, not even if the observer has full overview of the machine, machine inputs and outputs as well.

And the thought came to me, that the mirrormachine is essentially a simulation of an ever morphing computer that cannot be compromised by design:
can only go forward one instruction at a time - maintaining code integrity. And the thought thread spanned even further, because we can actually completely
reverse the model. Entropy does not have to be just a birthing nest for instructions: it can be the encoding medium for them.

routines can be integrity dependent or have its own integrity checkpoints in case of interrupts and code will be completely impossible
to reverse engineer or compromise - since each instruction will be uniquely encrypted and 1:1 executed as such by design.
Instructions are but a mist that never comes to existence, yet if the right path was followed to reach them, they take the right shape
to be executed, but _never to be observed_.

This computation model is a working statement of protection from the ever increasing speed of technological progress--We speed up the growth of tech
concepts, while we don't redirect merely enough momentum to protection againts virtual threats, and we accelerate towards a dystopian future where
nothing is secret anymore, no system can stand without being outcomputed, no math based encryption can stand unpenetrated, no AI model can protect
itself from another AI model, and no system where _1 = Truth_ is true anymore. If 1 equals truth, it means it can be computed. We need a new model.
A model where security is bound to the act of computation itself, not to some locked secrets or to mathematical riddles.
