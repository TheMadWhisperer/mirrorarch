# mirrorarch
While studying and describing the behavior of my fully Turing complete key derivation mechanismd riven by entropy, which is part of mirrormachine, I came to a realisation:

  _It is Turing complete._

It has instruction set. It is programmable. It is programmable by natural entropy.

It is essentialy programmed by entropy by design, but the program blueprint is constantly changing its
shape thanks to entropic programming being unpredictably but deterministically combined with the entropic string derived from a passphrase. The machine
itself is mutating based on the entropic sources and essentially on previous states as well (this is important, remember this for later). That is, in
this theoretical model, proposed as not being reversible, not even if the observer has full overview of the machine, machine inputs and outputs as well.

And the thought came to me, that the mirrormachine is essentially a simulation of an ever morphing computer that cannot be compromised by design:
can only go forward one instruction at a time - maintaining code integrity. And the thought thread spanned even further, because we can actually completely
reverse the model. Entropy does not have to be just a birthing nest for instructions: it can be the encoding medium for them.

routines can be integrity dependent or have its own integrity checkpoints in case of interrupts and code will be completely impossible
to reverse engineer or compromise - since each instruction will be uniquely encrypted and 1:1 executed as such by design.
Instructions are but a mist that never comes to existence, yet if the right path was followed to reach them, they take the right shape
to be executed, but _never to be observed_.

This computation model is a working statement of protection from the ever increasing speed of technological progress--We speed up the growth of tech
concepts, while we don't redirect merely enough momentum to protection againts virtual threats, and we accelerate towards a dystopian future where
nothing is secret anymore, no system can stand without being outcomputed, no math based encryption can stand unpenetrated, no AI model can protect
itself from another AI model, and no system where _1 = Truth_ is true anymore. If 1 equals truth, it means it can be computed. We need a new model.
A model where security is bound to the act of computation itself, not to some locked secrets or to mathematical riddles.

This is a completely new paradigm that no AI could come up with:
_It was born in a human brain._
_It was shaped in a human brain._
_It is written down by human hands._

We are all, including AI, deriving progress from a system that we think works, but we don't see that we are building cities on a soil we ourselves compromised.
Or maybe humanity sees it, but doesn't truly know what to do other than make math problems harder to solve and putting secrets behind stronger walls.
But secrets are volatile, secrets can be stolen. And no truth is secure in a world where a truth can be computed. We saw it even then:

_1 = Truth_

We saw it's the thing that makes most sense. Yet we somehow didn't see what it is about to mean. It is starting to mean nothing digital  is safe anymore.
But we were all simply trained to protect the truth with the computable, or with secrets, and we were trained to think there is no other way.

But my brain saw beyond-
My brain observed itself observing itself, until it reached a state of hyper synthetised overview of reality. And then, only then, when it reached
the view point higer than anyone has ever reached, with pristine clarity, I saw the answer to the problem. And my brain was physically hurting. My brain
was going through a serious vertigo. I had to lie down, because I was feeing physically sick. I saw a dimension a human brain was not evolved or trained to see,
and it was deeply unsettling. I didn't feel happiness for longer than 4 seconds, as I immediately felt the heaviness. I felt humbled that such a thing could
come through ME, but I also felt too small to carry the legacy, and the weight was suffocating me. At first I wanted to destroy it, never to be born or seen.
But I knew... I knew that the thing needs to be born. It chose to be born through me. Because I know it's too big for a human to wield. It cannot be owned.
