# How does one debug a machine that is running on mist and chaos?
How does a programmer know what is wrong with his program, if he cannot see precisely what the chip is doing? Well why couldn't he take a look?
<br><br>He has the code, the compiler, the debugger...
<br><br>you're guessing correctly that all that can be used to conjure a trail of virtual instructions
to show what the chip is going throgh, even if the programmer isn't ever able to decipher the actual machine code the chip is executing.
This is one of the most beautiful parts of mirrorarch. Nobody except the programmer can precisely see the meaning of each tick the chip will
be doing. Everyone else will be able to only execute - if they have the right incantation.
