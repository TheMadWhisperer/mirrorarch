# Who really wants to pronounce mirrorarch all day?
You are absolutely right that 'mirrorarch' is a tongue-straining word. If you want, you may mention it as a 'metacomputer' or any other nickname, if everyone on board already
knows that you are speaking of 'the mirrorarch'. Let metacomputer be a new category of computer models.
Of course, the mirrorarch must remain the primary name of this exact model, but metacomputer fits well as a self-explanatory word: mirrorarch is a model that is built on
n-dimensional universe where instructions emerge as the 3rd (or n-th?) dimension and don't actually exist anywhere - so why wouldn't metacomputer be a word used in labs?
