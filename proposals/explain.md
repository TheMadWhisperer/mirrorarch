# Who really wants to pronounce mirrorarch all day?
You are absolutely right that 'mirrorarch' is a tongue-straining word. If you want, you may mention it as a 'metacomputer' or any other nickname, if everyone on board already
knows that you are speaking of 'the mirrorarch'. Let metacomputer be a new category of computer models.
Of course, the mirrorarch must remain the primary name of this exact model, but metacomputer fits well as a self-explanatory word: mirrorarch is a model that is built on
n-dimensional universe where instructions emerge as the 3rd (or n-th?) dimension and don't actually exist anywhere - so why wouldn't metacomputer be a word used in labs?
<br><br>And yes, this is how you may explain mirrorarch in maximum simplicity:
<br>"...it is a model that is built on
n-dimensional universe where instructions emerge as the n-th dimension and don't actually exist anywhere until they are about to be executed by the processor. And what is about to happen is only between the programmer, the compiler and the processor."
