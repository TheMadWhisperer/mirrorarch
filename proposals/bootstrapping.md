# How do you build a house from bricks that rely on integrity so much?

A pact of trust is your answer. Each shared library might have a header of functions as a guide rail for the program loading it.
How does the program call a function from a different program in a system like this one? If you want to load a shared library,
all you need to use along with the shared library file is a key derived from a passphrase. If you apply just the right key,
you will be welcomed to the world that only the library can see - you will suddenly speak the common tongue. If we start building
from bottom to top, we may soon arrive to a system that has a perfectly aligned ecosystem - trust is established where it is needed,
in the directions where it feels safe.
